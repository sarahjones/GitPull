GitPush
=======

A script that includes the committing any uncommitted files into a temporary commit, a pull, a reset to undo the temporary commit, and a push.


Known issues/feature requests:
- Failure if there are no files for the temporary commit
- should be able to pick up from an unfinished script (say due to merge failure) 
- perhaps make a less verbose version?
